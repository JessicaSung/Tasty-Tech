Git Conflict Resolver
---------------------

  Git Conflict Resolver
  ===========================
  
  A Sublime Text plugin to help you solve this nasty merge conflicts.
  
  Commands
  ---------
  
  Git Conflict Resolver ships with five commands: "Find Next Conflict", "Keep Ours", "Keep Theirs", "Keep Common Ancestor" and "Show Conflict Files".
  
  While most of them are pretty self explaining, the "Keep Common Ancestor" could need some elaboration:
  This command is especially useful for the diff3 conflict type of Git. If you have no idea what I'm talking about then
  check it out (http://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) it's great! (Just search for diff3 on the page)
  
  Some clarification:
  The first block always represents "our" while the last block is always "theirs".
  
  Configuration
  -------------
  
  To configure the plugin you can use a user-settings file in your user folder. You can easily access this file other "Preferences" -> "Git Conflict Resolver" -> "Settings - User".
  
  For information on which settings are available take a look at the commented default-settings file:
  
  {
      // The git path
      // by default the plugin assumes that git is in your path
      "git_path": "git",
  
      // Enable or disable the live matching of conflict areas
      // By default the plugin matches live
      "live_matching": true,
  
      // The color of the highlighting is called "scope" in Sublime Text,
      // to change this color you can choose a different scope.
      // This customization isn't easy, since you have to define your own
      // scope in your theme file.
      "matching_scope": "invalid",
  
      // This option enables the filling the conflict area with a color
      // By default the area will just be outlined
      "fill_conflict_area": false,
  
      // This option enables the outline of the conflict area
      // By default the area will just be outlined
      // In Sublime Text 2 the area will only be outlined if "fill_conflict_area" is false
      "outline_conflict_area": true,
  
      // This options enable the gutter marks for the different conflict groups
      "ours_gutter": true,
      "theirs_gutter": true,
      "ancestor_gutter": true,
  
      // This option changes the display of the "Show Conflict Files" functionality"
      // true: Show only the filesnames ("src/main.js" becomes "main.js")
      // false: Show relative path (from the root of the repository)
      // By default Git Conflict Resolver only shows the filename
      "show_only_filename": true
  }
  
  Shortcuts
